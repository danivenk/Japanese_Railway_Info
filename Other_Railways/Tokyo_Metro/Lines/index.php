			Tokyo Metro Ginza Line 01 series EMUs at Shibuya Station</div>
			<p>The Tokyo Metro Ginza Line (東京地下鉄銀座線 Tōkyō Chikatetsu Ginza-sen) is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan. It is part of the of Tokyo Metro network. The official name is Line 3 Ginza Line (3号線銀座線 3-gōsen Ginza-sen). It is 14.3 km long and serves the wards of Shibuya, Minato, Chūō, Chiyoda, and Taitō. The line holds the distinction of being the oldest subway line in Asia. On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color orange, and its stations are given numbers using the letter G. The subway has a third rail power source (With that it's 1 of the 2 subway lines that have a thrid rail power source, all other subway lines have overhead power). During the weekdays the Ginza Line operates every 2 minutes in peak hours, every 2 minutes and 15 seconds in evening peak hours and every 3 minutes in the dayhours.</p>

			<p><strong>History</strong><br>
			The Ginza Line was conceived by a businessman named Noritsugu Hayakawa, who visited London in 1914, saw the London Underground and concluded that Tokyo needed its own underground railway. He founded the Tokyo Underground Railway (東京地下鉄道 Tōkyō Chika Tetsudō) in 1920, and began construction in 1925.</p>

			<p>On January 1, 1930, the subway was extended by 1.7 km to temporary Manseibashi Station, abandoned on November 21, 1931 when the subway reached Kanda, 500 meters further down south the line. The Great Depression slowed down construction, but the line finally reached its originally planned terminus of Shinbashi on June 21, 1934.</p>

			<p>In 1938, the Tōkyō Rapid Railway (東京高速鉄道 Tōkyō Kōsoku Tetsudō), a company tied to the predecessor of today's Tokyu Corporation, began service between Shibuya and Toranomon, later extended to Shinbashi in 1939. The two lines began through-service interoperation in 1939 and were formally merged as the Teito Rapid Transit Authority ("Eidan Subway" or "TRTA") in July 1941.</p>

			<p>The "Ginza Line" name was applied in 1953 to distinguish the line from the new Marunouchi Line. In the postwar economic boom, the Ginza Line became increasingly crowded. The new Hanzōmon Line began to relieve the Ginza Line's traffic in the 1980s, but the Ginza Line is still quite crowded as it serves major residential, commercial, and business districts in central Tokyo. According to a June 2009 Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation survey, the Ginza Line is the seventh most crowded subway line in Tokyo, running at 168% capacity between Akasaka-Mitsuke and Tameike-Sannō stations.</p>

			<p>The newest station on the line, Tameike-Sannō Station, opened in 1997 to provide a connection to the newly built Namboku Line.</p>

			A Tokyo Metro 02 series EMU</div>
			<p>The Tokyo Metro Marunouchi Line (東京地下鉄丸ノ内線 Tōkyō Chikatetsu Marunouchi-sen) is a subway line of the Tokyo Metro system in Tokyo, Japan. The line runs in a U-shape between Ogikubo Station in Suginami and Ikebukuro Station in Toshima, with a branch line between Nakano-Sakaue Station and Hōnanchō Station. The official name is Line 4 Marunouchi Line (4号線丸ノ内線 Yon-gōsen Marunouchi-sen). The Marunouchi Line is one of the 2 third rail lines of the Tokyo Metro Subway company. All other lines have overhead power.</p>

			<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
			The Marunouchi Line is the second line to be built in the city, and the first one constructed after the Second World War. The route is U-shaped, running from Ogikubo Station in the west of the city via the commercial and administrative district of Shinjuku through to the Marunouchi commercial center around Tokyo Station, before turning back and heading to Ikebukuro.</p>

			<p>The Marunouchi Line is served by Tokyo Metro 02 series rolling stock in six-car trains on the main line, and three-car trains on the Hōnanchō branch. The main line is the most frequent subway line in Tokyo, with trains running at intervals of 1 minute 50 seconds during peak hours. In spite of such high-frequency service, according to a 2008 survey by the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism the Marunouchi Line is one of the most crowded railway lines in Tokyo, running at 157% capacity between Shin-ōtsuka and Myōgadani stations. Its age and relatively short train length has made it one of the most crowded lines in Tokyo, although the 2000 opening of the Toei Ōedo Line has relieved the problem somewhat. In response to crowding, Tokyo Metro upgraded all stations with chest-high platform doors on March 28, 2009, a date on which it also began driver-only operation . The Hōnanchō branch switched to driver-only operation in July 2004.</p>

			<p>Due to the age of the Marunouchi Line and the relative shallowness at which it runs, at several points in central Tokyo trains run at or above ground level. These include Yotsuya Station, the Kanda River near Ochanomizu Station (see image), and between Kōrakuen and Myōgadani stations.</p>

			<p>On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color "red". Its stations are given numbers using the letter M; Hōnanchō branch line stations carry a lowercase m.</p>

			<p><strong>History</strong><br>
			The Marunouchi Line is the second subway line to be built in the city, and the first to be constructed after the Second World War. Its design is similar to that of the Ginza Line, the oldest subway line in Tokyo. Both lines are standard gauge and use third-rail power, unlike the other Tokyo subway lines.</p>

			<p>The first section was opened between Ikebukuro and Ochanomizu on 20 January 1954. The subsequent progress of the line was as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>Ochanomizu to Awajichō: March 1956</li>
				<li>Awajichō to Tokyo: July 1956</li>
				<li>Tokyo to Nishi-Ginza (now Ginza): December 1957</li>
				<li>Nishi-Ginza to Kasumigaseki: October 1958</li>
				<li>Kasumigaseki to Shinjuku: March 1959</li>

				<li>Minami-Asagaya to Ogikubo: January 23, 1962</li>
				<li>Nakano-Fujimichō to Hōnanchō: March 23, 1962</li>
				<li>Nishi-Ginza becomes part of Ginza when Hibiya Line reaches there: August 1964</li>
				<li>Higashi-Kōenji opens (between Shin-Nakano and Shin-Kōenji): September 1964</li>

			A Tokyo Metro 03 series EMU at Hiroo Station bound for Kita-Senju</div>
			<p>The Tokyo Metro Hibiya Line (東京地下鉄日比谷線 Tōkyō Chikatetsu Hibiya-sen) is a subway line in Tokyo, Japan, owned and operated by Tokyo Metro. The line was named after the district of Hibiya, under which it passes. The official name is Line 2 Hibiya Line (2号線日比谷線 Ni-gōsen Ginza-sen).</p>

			<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
			The Hibiya Line runs between Naka-Meguro in Meguro and Kita-Senju in Adachi. The line's path is somewhat similar to that of the Ginza Line; however, the Hibiya Line was designed to serve a number of important districts, such as Ebisu, Roppongi, Tsukiji, Kayabachō and Senju, which were not on an existing line.</p>

			<p>The Hibiya Line is connected to the Tobu Skytree Line at Kita-Senju, and through services operate between Naka-Meguro and Tōbu-Dōbutsu-Kōen on the Tobu Skytee Line, and onward to Minami-Kurihashi on the Tōbu Nikkō Line. Some peak-hour services terminate at Takenotsuka, Kita-Koshigaya or Kita-Kasukabe on the Tobu Skytree Line.</p>

			<p>Prior to 16 March 2013, when through-running began between the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line and the Tokyu Toyoko Line, Hibiya Line trains also inter-ran via the Tokyu Toyoko Line to Kikuna.</p>

			<p>According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Hibiya Line is the eighth most crowded subway line in Tokyo, running at 164% capacity between Minowa and Iriya stations.</p>

			<p>On maps, diagrams and signboards, the line is shown using the color "silver", and its stations are numbered with the prefix "H"</p>

			<p><strong>History</strong><br>
			The Hibiya Line was the fourth subway line built in Tokyo after the Ginza Line, Marunouchi Line, and Toei Asakusa Line.

			Its basic plan was drawn up by a Ministry of Transportation committee in 1957. Called "Line 2" at the time, it was designed to connect Naka-Meguro in southwest Tokyo with Kita-Koshigaya in the northeast. The full northeastern extension of the line was never built, as the Tobu Railway upgraded to quadruple track within the same corridor to meet capacity demands.

			Work began in 1959, with the first section opening in March 1961. The line opened in stages: the northern section, between Kita-Senju and Ningyōchō, was operational in May 1962; the southern section, between Naka-Meguro and Kasumigaseki, opened in March 1964. The final segment, bridging Higashi-Ginza and Kasumigaseki, opened on August 29, 1964, just weeks before the opening ceremony for the 1964 Summer Olympics. This was something of a coup for the Teito Rapid Transit Authority (the predecessor of today's Tokyo Metro), as the Toei Asakusa Line, which was also to be completed in time for the Olympics, had fallen behind schedule and remained under construction for the duration of the Games.

			The Hibiya Line was one of the lines targeted in the 1995 Aum sarin gas attack.

			On March 8, 2000, five people were killed and 63 were injured when a derailed Hibiya Line train was sideswiped by a second train near Naka-Meguro Station.</p>

			<p>The Tōzai Line (東西線 Tōzai-sen) is a rapid transit line in Tokyo and Chiba Prefecture, Japan, owned and operated by Tokyo Metro. Its name literally means East-West Line. The line runs between Nakano Station in Nakano, Tokyo and Nishi-Funabashi Station in Funabashi, Chiba. The Tōzai Line was referred to as Line 5 during the planning stages, thus the seldom-used official name is Line 5 Tōzai Line (5号線東西線 Go-gō-sen Tōzai-sen). This line rides on a overhead power supply.</p>

			<p><strong>Overview</strong><br>
			Trains run through onto the East Japan Railway Company (JR East)'s Chūō-Sōbu Line for Mitaka and the Tōyō Rapid Railway Line for Tōyō-Katsutadai, making the line an alternative route to the Chūō-Sōbu between Nakano and Nishi-Funabashi.</p>

			<p>According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Tokyo Metro Tōzai Line was the most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 199% capacity between Kiba and Monzen-Nakachō stations.[2] Women-only cars were introduced on the line during morning rush hours starting on November 20, 2006.</p>

			<p>On maps, diagrams and signboards, the Tōzai Line is shown using the color "sky blue", and its stations are given numbers using the letter T.</p>

			<p><strong>Service</strong><br>
			The Tōzai Line was the first Tokyo Metro line on which express services run: three types of rapid trains skip some stations east of Tōyōchō. The Fukutoshin Line began services on June 14, 2008 and also features express services.</p>

			<p>Through services to Mitaka via the JR East Chūō-Sōbu Line and Tōyō-Katsutadai via the Tōyō Rapid Railway run all day. During the morning and evening peak periods, through services run to Tsudanuma via the JR East Sōbu Main Line.</p>

			<p><strong>History</strong><br>
			The Tōzai Line was planned by a review committee of the then Ministry of Transportation in 1962 and numbered Line 5. Its name literally means "East-West Line", and it was primarily planned to relieve traffic on the busy Sōbu Main Line as well as provide a straight crosstown connection through north-central Tokyo. Although this corridor is now served by the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation (Toei) Shinjuku Line and JR Keiyō Line as well, the Tōzai Line continues to operate beyond capacity due to its accessibility to other lines, as well as to growing condominium developments in eastern Tokyo.</p>

			<p>The Takadanobaba to Kudanshita section opened in 1964, and the remainder opened in stages until its completion in 1969. Through service with the then Japan National Railways began in 1969 connecting the Chūō and Sōbu lines.</p>

			<p>The Tōyō Rapid Railway Line, effectively an eastward extension of the line, opened in 1996.</p>

			<p>Trains have through running onto other railway lines on both ends. More than half of these are trains to the northeast beyond Ayase onto the East Japan Railway Company (JR East) Joban Line to Toride. The rest run to the southwest beyond Yoyogi-Uehara onto the Odakyū Odawara Line to Hon-Atsugi and to Karakida on the Odakyu Tama Line.</p>

			<p>According to the Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation, as of June 2009 the Chiyoda Line was the second most crowded subway line in Tokyo, at its peak running at 181% capacity between Machiya and Nishi-Nippori stations.</p>

			<p><strong>History</strong><br>
			The Chiyoda Line was originally proposed in 1962 as a line from Setagaya in Tokyo to Matsudo, Chiba; the initial name was "Line 8". In 1964, the plan was changed slightly so that through service would be offered on the Joban Line north of Tokyo, and the number was changed to "Line 9".</p>

			<p>Line 9 was designed to pass through built-up areas in Chiyoda, and also intended to relieve the busy Ginza Line and Hibiya Line, which follow a roughly similar route through central Tokyo.</p>

			<p>The first stretch was opened on December 20, 1969 between Kita-Senju and Ōtemachi. The line was almost completed by October 10, 1972 when it reached Yoyogi-Kōen, although the 1 km section to Yoyogi-Uehara was not completed until March 31, 1978. The branch line to Kita-Ayase was opened on December 20, 1979.</p>

			<p>On May 15, 2006, women-only cars were introduced on early-morning trains from Toride on the Joban Line to Yoyogi-Uehara.</p>

			<p>From March 18, 2008, Odakyu Romancecar limited express services began running between Kita-Senju and Hakone-Yumoto (on the Hakone Tozan Line) and Karakida (on the Odakyu Tama Line). Trains also run from/to Shin-Kiba using tracks connecting to the Yurakucho Line. It is the first time that reserved-seating trains have operated on a Japanese subway line.</p>
